| 34 | COMPLETED | Resolve F-PASS14-I1 bats count decision | hook-performance tests fold into hooks.bats; 9-suite count preserved |
| 35 | COMPLETED | Fix-burst v0.4.8 → v0.4.9 | Fixed I1 (bats count) + I2 (/brain:research label "new" in Scope) |
| 36 | COMPLETED | Commit Pass 14 FAIL report | SHA: 7f8572c |
| 37 | COMPLETED | Amend CLAUDE.md with Node 20+ constraint | L5 updated at Stage 3 |

| 39 | IN-PROGRESS | Pass 15 adversary dispatch | Dispatched background agent `aa57a4dca72a13c1a`; result not yet in at handoff time |

## Next steps (in dependency order)

1. Resolve Pass 15 result (see SESSION-HANDOFF.md §9 for resume procedure)
2. If Pass 15 PASS → dispatch Pass 16 (streak 1/3)
3. If Pass 15 FAIL → fix-burst → v0.5.0 → dispatch Pass 16
4. Continue until streak 3/3 → mark Task 6 (Stage 6 Finalize) as ready
5. After convergence: execute Task 23 (post-convergence git cleanup)
