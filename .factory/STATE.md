# brain-factory Pipeline STATE

This is the canonical state-discovery entry point. Read it FIRST when starting any new orchestrator session.

## Pass 11 Recovery Note (historical)

Pass 11 architect work was interrupted mid-commit on 2026-05-16 and recovered via Option A pre-authorized commit at SHA a3a83b1; cascade resumed without re-running architect work. Pass 11 state-mgr FINAL closed this burst. Pass 11 also produced two corrective bursts within the architect role (343c378, c35de6f) — see TD-VSDD-053-spirit advisory section below.

---

## Current pipeline position

**Mode:** GREENFIELD (no existing implementation; planning artifacts in `docs/planning/` serve as Phase 0 equivalent).

**Phase:** 1d Adversarial spec review — IN-PROGRESS.

**Top-of-stack action:** Dispatch Pass 14 adversary per BC-5.39.001 cascade protocol (chat-only output per F-PASS12-O1 codification).

## Phase 1a Stage 5 — CLOSED

The brain-factory product brief reached BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN convergence after 23 adversary passes and 15 fix-bursts:
- **Final brief:** `.factory/specs/product-brief.md` v0.4.15, 802 lines, commit 9ff0504
- **Convergence:** Streak 3/3 reached at Pass 22 on v0.4.14; preserved through post-convergence cleanup at Pass 23 on v0.4.15
- **Final pass report:** `.factory/cycles/v0.1-phase-1a-brief/adversary-pass-23.md`

## Phase 1b PRD entry — COMPLETED

PRD v0.1.1 landed at commit 7935faa. 95 BCs across 18 subsystems, 1 BC-INDEX, 4 supplements. Consistency audit CONDITIONAL-GO; 4 of 5 findings closed. Independent orchestrator verification: CLEAN.

## Phase 1c Architecture entry — COMPLETED

Architecture v0.1.1 landed via 5 commits (b7679ee through d89ea4b). ARCH-INDEX + 17 ADRs + 18 SS-NN designs + 27 VPs (64/64 P0 BC coverage). Five-file gate canonical. Independent orchestrator verification: CLEAN.

## 21+ Structural-Fix Disciplines Codified During Phase 1d

Inherited from Phase 1a (13 disciplines — see brief v0.4.19 Changelog or SESSION-HANDOFF §5).

Phase 1d additions (13 confirmed committed disciplines):
1. (Pass 4) Sweep-by-canonical-pattern — for canonical-target patterns (tests/X.bats), sweep both positive (present) and negative (deprecated absent)
2. (Pass 5) last_updated freshness check — last_updated >= max(changelog date)
3. (Pass 6) inherits_from chain integrity — child references parent's current version per Option B (pin-at-burst-end)
4. (Pass 6) Plain-prose `line N` Clause 2 gate — sibling to L-prefixed Clause 1 gate
5. (Pass 7) Sequential pass-closure discipline — bursts run sequentially (persist → architect → PO → state-mgr FINAL), not parallel; Option B parallel-burst hazard mitigation
6. (Pass 8) Operational state doc path-currency check — test -e on every cited path
7. (Pass 9) In-document title-cell sibling-sweep — within ARCH-INDEX, Doc Map cells match VP-INDEX Summary cells
8. (Pass 10) Dual-scope discipline — every codified discipline declares incremental scope + canonical-baseline scope (one-time sweep at codification)
9. (Pass 11) Timestamp tri-partite semantic (created / timestamp / last_updated) + canonical-baseline sweep (F-PASS11-C1/I3)
10. (Pass 11) Retroactive dual-scope audit on codification of any new meta-rule (F-PASS11-C2)
11. (Pass 11) Adversary pre-flight grep verification before flagging writing-tech recursion findings (F-PASS11-O1)
12. (Pass 12) SS-NN Changelog discipline tightened to trigger on ANY content edit, not just version > 1.0 (F-PASS12-I2)
13. (Pass 12) Adversary dispatch chat-only protocol — read-only adversary cannot Write or Commit; orchestrator must dispatch with chat-output only instructions and route persistence via state-manager (F-PASS12-O1)
14. (Pass 13) Architecture artifact Changelog discipline extended to all SS/ADR/VP artifact types — same trigger (content-edit detected via timestamp > created), same Changelog-section requirement; bash sweep updated to cover all three artifact types (F-PASS13-C2)
15. (Pass 13) Count balance check Self-Audit sub-rule — for any count claim in a canonical-baseline-scope clause (N bumped / M retained), verify N + M = total artifact count cited in the same clause before commit (F-PASS13-C1)
16. (Pass 13) Cascade table FINAL-marker format change — state-mgr FINAL rows no longer carry self-SHA placeholder; use textual marker "state-mgr FINAL ✓ (this commit)" instead; self-SHA back-fill bursts eliminated going forward (F-PASS13-I1 closure)

## TD-VSDD-053-spirit Advisories (corrective-burst-within-pass pattern)

Phase 1d has produced "corrective burst within same logical pass" sequences that survive the single-commit-chain hook detector (no banned theme word) but violate TD-VSDD-053 in spirit. Documented audit trail (not retroactively rebased):

- Pass 11: architect a3a83b1 → 343c378 (missing changelog header correction) → c35de6f (hallucinated inventory correction); state-mgr e37f1e3 → 7ea3f71 (back-fill self-SHA). 5 commits in one logical Pass 11 cycle.
- Pass 12: clean (1 architect + 1 PO + 1 state-mgr FINAL = 3 commits, one per agent role). Pass 12 state-mgr FINAL left a `[this burst]` placeholder for its own SHA (0781716) — back-filled in Pass 13 state-mgr FINAL.
- Pass 13: clean (1 architect + 1 state-mgr FINAL = 2 commits, one per agent role). No PO burst this pass; architect handled all routed findings.

Going-forward orchestrator discipline: dispatch agents with explicit single-commit-per-burst instructions; verify draft outputs before commit to avoid corrective bursts.

Pass 13 closure adopts the new self-SHA-free FINAL-marker format. Pass 11 and Pass 12 historical placeholders cleaned in this burst. Going forward, no FINAL self-SHA back-fill bursts needed — state-mgr FINAL rows carry "✓ (this commit)" as the textual marker; git log is the authoritative source for the actual SHA.

## state-manager FINAL discipline (8 sub-checks)

Before committing, state-manager FINAL MUST run:
- (a) inherits_from re-pin to post-all-bursts parent versions
- (b) path-currency check via `test -e` on all cited .factory/specs/ paths
- (c) absolute-quantity audit — verify counts match actual artifact state
- (d) cited-SHA verification — confirm all commit SHAs cited in state docs exist
- (e) changelog factual-accuracy spot-check — scan for corrective-NOTE pattern
- (f) in-document title-cell sibling-sweep — ARCH-INDEX Document Map vs VP-INDEX Summary
- (g) dual-scope discipline verification — every newly codified discipline declares both scopes
- (h) adversary pre-flight verification — confirm the adversary pre-flight discipline is correctly stated (incremental + canonical-baseline scopes declared) in ARCH-INDEX Self-Audit Checklist (F-PASS11-O1)

## Resume procedure for FRESH-CONTEXT ORCHESTRATOR

### Step 0 — Worktree health check (BLOCKING)

```
Agent(subagent_type="vsdd-factory:devops-engineer", prompt="cd /Users/jmagady/Dev/brain-factory && run factory-worktree-health skill")
```
Expected: .factory/ regular directory on main per §10 (intentional pre-v0.1).

### Step 1 — Read these documents IN ORDER

1. `/Users/jmagady/Dev/brain-factory/CLAUDE.md`
2. `/Users/jmagady/Dev/brain-factory/.factory/STATE.md` (this file)
3. `/Users/jmagady/Dev/brain-factory/.factory/SESSION-HANDOFF.md`
4. `/Users/jmagady/Dev/brain-factory/.factory/TASK-LIST.md`
5. `/Users/jmagady/Dev/brain-factory/.factory/cycles/v0.1-phase-1d-spec/adversary-pass-13.md` (latest pass report)

### Step 2 — Continue cascade

Dispatch Pass 14 adversary per BC-5.39.001 cascade protocol. IMPORTANT: Pass 14 dispatch MUST use chat-only output protocol (adversary produces findings as chat text; orchestrator routes to state-manager for persistence; adversary must NOT be instructed to Write or Commit files). Target: streak 3/3 for convergence.

## Open questions for human

1. **Worktree migration** — should `.factory/` migrate from regular-directory-on-main to orphan-branch worktree before v0.1? Defer to Phase 2 prep or v0.1 release prep.

2. **Pass 19 escalation** — add a real `.factory/hooks/validate-changelog-anchors.sh`? DEFER-TO-PHASE-1D.

3. **Phase 1d convergence threshold** — cascade has run 13 passes finding a mix of meta-rule application failures and genuine content defects. At what point does the user accept "convergence by stable discipline catalog" vs strict 3/3 zero-finding? Pass 13 surfaced real count-correction and scope-extension defects (ADR/VP Changelog discipline, count arithmetic), supporting continued cascade.
